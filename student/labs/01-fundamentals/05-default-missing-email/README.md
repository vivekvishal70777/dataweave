# Lab 05 — Default missing email

**Level:** easy  
**Section folder:** `01-fundamentals`

## Try this first

1. Open DataWeave Playground or Transform Message.
2. Set the input MIME type to match the sample (JSON unless stated otherwise).
3. Paste `input` into the payload.
4. Complete `transform.dwl`. Do not open the instructor solution until you have an attempt.

## Problem

**Problem:** If `email` is null or missing, use `"na@example.com"`.

**Input:** `{ "name": "Sam" }`

**Expected:** `{ "name": "Sam", "email": "na@example.com" }`

**Solution:** Hidden until you try it. See `instructor/solutions`.
